A type of majority finding algrithm but unlike moore which finds element with >n/2 occurences. This algorithm is generalised for finding elements having occurrences
greater than n/k. We make k-1 memory units and keep count of elements and their values.
  1. read the stream and if element is present update the count.
  2. If element is new and there is space , then insert and set count=1
  3. Else if there is no space  reduce the counts of all the memory units by 1.
  
  
  The algorithm claims that in the end , the memory units contain the candidates for occurence > n/k
  
  
  The algorithm is really useful
