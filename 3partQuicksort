THe idea is pretty simple and it can give the worst case to be O(nlogn). The problem of duplicates is reduced here.

My explaination:

1. Array will have 4 part  lefmost contains elements equal to pivot
2. 2 contains elements smaller
3. 3 contains elements greater
4. 4 conatins elements equal

We do normal iteration just like quicksort from both sides and if we find a equal element then move it to end. Don't worry since elements on the left are already smaller
it would do no harm.
In the end we move equal elements on the left and right to the center and then we will have two arrays with smaller and greater elements.
Recursively call them.

Idea is pretty insane :)
